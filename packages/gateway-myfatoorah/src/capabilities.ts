 * Conservative MyFatoorah claims for this adapter surface.
 *
 * V3 `PaymentURL` is a hosted-page **redirect**, not a first-class Checkout
 * Session product (`hostedCheckout` stays false) — same honesty as Tap
 * `src_all`. Authorize / capture / void exist on MyFatoorah but need portal
 * enablement and are not implemented here. Tokenization is claimed because
 * `SourceOfFund.Token` / `SessionId` via `myfatoorahToken` /
 * `myfatoorahSessionId` is implemented and tested (gateway.test.ts:283) —
 * direct card PAN (`SourceOfFund.Card`) is still rejected before any fetch.
 * Customers, payment links, splits, disputes, and recurring are not
 * implemented.
