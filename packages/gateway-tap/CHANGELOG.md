# @paykernel/gateway-tap

## Unreleased

### Minor

- **Phase 23:** first-party portable Tap Payments adapter (`tapGateway` / `TapGateway`). Charges, authorize/capture/void, refunds, and HMAC-SHA256 `hashstring` webhooks. Conservative capability claims. Not a core built-in.

### Patch

- **TAP-WEBHOOK-HTTPS:** Config `webhookUrl` and per-request `tapPostUrl` must be HTTPS. `http://` and unparseable URLs are `InvalidRequestError`.
- **TAP-HTTP-11XX-REST:** Unlisted Tap `11xx` / `41xx` / `2100` / `2103` / `2108` JSON error codes are `InvalidRequestError`. Auth / not-found / amount / `1151` keep their existing maps. HTTP 5xx is still `NetworkError`.
- **TAP-REFUND-OMITTED:** Omitted refund amount without remaining/refunded on the charge throws `InvalidRequestError` (do not resend `charge.amount`). Remaining is used when exposed; remaining `0` still replays. A `refunds` list that mixes parseable and opaque amounts is fail-closed.
- **TAP-CLIENT-OVERLOAD:** `createPaymentClient({ defaultGateway: "tap" })` (gateways map or registry) types `createPayment` / `capturePayment` / `refundPayment` from the registered gateway (Tap `tap*` fields) without adding those keys to core `CreatePaymentParams`.
- **TAP-GOD-CLASS:** Refund remaining math lives in `refund-support.ts`; webhook identity / invoice parse live in `webhook-map.ts`.
- **TAP-CAPTURE-3DS:** Capture still sends `threeDSecure: true` and `customer_initiated: true`. Passing `false` throws (Tap forbids those false on authorize capture).
- **TAP-REFUND-REPLAY:** A charge already `REFUNDED` is a crash-replay, not `InvalidRequestError`. The same `idempotencyKey` returns the original refund, or a nested refund whose `reference.idempotent` matches (a single nested refund is still mapped). Multiple unmatched nested refunds POST the key.
- **TAP-CAPTURE-CHARGE-ID:** `getPayment(auth_…)` on a CAPTURED authorize uses nested `charge_id` when present (`gatewayId` is `chg_…`, `authorizationId` is `auth_…`). Without `charge_id`, paid + `authorizationId` `auth_…` — refunds still need a `chg_…` from capture POST or a charge webhook.
- **TAP-VOID-GET-OUTCOME:** `getPayment` of VOID is `outcome: "succeeded"` + `status: "cancelled"` (same as `voidPayment`), not `failed`. ABANDONED / CANCELLED stay `failed`.
- **TAP-INVOICE-PARSE:** Well-formed invoice webhook objects parse as non-paid (`cancelled`) so they are not fulfilled. Missing `id` or `created` still throws.
- **TAP-SAVE-CARD:** Create and capture POST send `save_card: false`.
- **TAP-ABORT-RETRY:** Caller-abort `NetworkError` after a mutating POST is not retried.
- **TAP-HTTP-5XX-ORDER:** HTTP 5xx maps to `NetworkError` before Tap JSON `1106` / other 11xx body codes. A 5xx body that includes `1106` is not `InvalidRequestError`.
- **TAP-WEBHOOK-AUTH-CHARGE:** Authorize webhook objects set `relatedIds.chargeId` when `charge_id` is present.
- **TAP-CHARGE-REFUNDED:** Charge object status `REFUNDED` maps to payment `refunded` (`getPayment` and charge webhooks), not `failed`. Refund *objects* were already `refunded`.
- **TAP-MISSING-STATUS:** Mutating HTTP 2xx with an `id` but no object `status` is `indeterminate` (`afterProviderSubmit`). Missing status is not mapped as Tap `UNKNOWN` → `failed`.
- **TAP-CAPTURE-REPLAY:** `capturePayment` GETs the authorize. `AUTHORIZED` POSTs `/charges`. `CAPTURED` does not POST — returns paid and keeps `authorizationId` (crash-retry after a completed capture). Replaying POST on an already-captured `auth_…` is Tap `1126`.
- **TAP-AUTH-CHARGE-ID:** Capture result `authorizationId` is the `auth_…` id; `gatewayId` is the charge `chg_…` id. Capture does not drop the authorize id when mapping the charge.
- **TAP-REFUND-REMAINING:** Omitted refund `amount` is the remaining refundable amount when the charge exposes `refunded` / remaining. If remaining is not exposed, pass `amount` explicitly (see TAP-REFUND-OMITTED).
- **TAP-CURRENCY-MATCH:** Capture and refund `currency` must match the authorize / charge. Mismatch is `InvalidRequestError` (Tap `1149`).
- **TAP-CREATE-RECONCILE:** `createPayment` timeout / 5xx / `1151` after submit: replay `createPayment` with the same `idempotencyKey`. Do not `getPayment` until you have a `chg_…` or `auth_…` id. capture / void / refund timeouts: `getPayment` with the stored id.
- **TAP-HTTP-11XX:** Tap error codes `1126` ("Source already used") and `1149` ("Currency code is not matching") are `InvalidRequestError`, not untyped `GatewayApiError`.
- **TAP-CUSTOMER-FIELDS:** Inline `tapCustomer` requires non-empty `firstName`, `lastName`, and `email`. Blank names or email are rejected (Tap `1130` / `1132` / `1138`).
- **TAP-DECLINE-CODES:** Charge `FAILED` with `response.code` `501`–`516` is `declined` (with decline extras), not a generic `failed`. `DECLINED` is unchanged.
- **TAP-REASON-LENGTH:** Refund `reason` longer than 249 characters is rejected (`InvalidRequestError`; Tap `1157`).
- **TAP-KEY-TRIM:** Config `secretKey` is trimmed. Whitespace-only keys remain invalid.
- **TAP-REDIRECT-URL:** Result `redirectUrl` / `nextAction` is `transaction.url` only. Merchant `redirect.url` (`callbackUrl`) is never a checkout next action. CAPTURED / AUTHORIZED must not redirect from that echo URL.
- **TAP-UDF1-PAYMENT-ID:** Webhook `paymentId` is `metadata.paymentId` / `metadata.orderId` / `reference.order` — never `metadata.udf1`.
- **TAP-REFUND-POST:** Refund POST includes `post.url` from config `webhookUrl` when set.
- **TAP-FAWRY-IN-PROGRESS:** Charge status `IN PROGRESS` / `IN_PROGRESS` (Fawry) maps to `pending` / `requires_action` like other pending statuses — not `failed`. All pending statuses are `requires_action`; `transaction.url` is only the redirect target when present.
- **TAP-TOTAL-REFUNDED:** Refund results omit `totalRefunded`. A single refund `amount` is not a cumulative total; the adapter does not invent `0`.
- **TAP-CAPTURE-BODY:** Capture POST sends `merchant.id` from config and `post.url` from `webhookUrl` when set.
- **TAP-CAPTURE-STATUS:** Capture requires GET authorize `AUTHORIZED` then `POST /charges`. GET `CAPTURED` does not POST — returns paid and keeps `authorizationId` (crash-retry after a completed capture). `VOID` is rejected — the hold was released, not captured.
- **TAP-REFUND-ACCEPTED:** Refund object `ACCEPTED` maps to pending / `refund_pending`, not failed. Do not fulfill or retry as failure.
- **TAP-AUTH-LEFTOVER-URL:** Leftover `transaction.url` on AUTHORIZED / CAPTURED is not `requires_action`.
- **TAP-CAPTURE-FIELDS:** Capture POST sends `threeDSecure: true` and `customer_initiated: true`.
- **TAP-AUTHORIZE-AUTO:** Optional config `autoVoidHours` is sent as authorize-create `auto: { type: "VOID", time }` only. It is not defaulted.
- **TAP-AUTHORIZE-SOURCE:** `capture: false` omitted `tapSource` defaults to `src_card` (charges still default `src_all`).
- **TAP-CREATE-AUTH-SOURCE:** `createPayment` rejects `auth_…` source ids. Capture with `capturePayment`.
- **TAP-IN-PROGRESS-UNDERSCORE:** Charge / refund status `IN_PROGRESS` is treated like `IN PROGRESS` (pending).
- **TAP-HTTP-50X:** HTTP 5xx maps to `NetworkError` (mutating → `afterProviderSubmit`). It is not a card decline even if a JSON error code looks like `50x`.
- **TAP-1106-CUSTOMER:** Tap error `1106` ("Customer not found") is `InvalidRequestError`, not payment `ResourceNotFoundError`.
- **TAP-ZERO-AMOUNT:** Outbound amounts must be `> 0`. Zero is rejected.
- **TAP-1114-STATUS:** Tap error `1114` ("Please check the Authorize status") is a typed `InvalidRequestError` (fail closed), not an untyped `GatewayApiError`.
- **TAP-LAST-NAME:** Inline `tapCustomer` requires `lastName` (Tap error `1132`). Existing `cus_…` ids are unchanged.
- **TAP-CAPTURE-REDIRECT:** Capture `POST /charges` sends `redirect.url` from `tapRedirectUrl` or the authorize object’s `redirect.url`. Missing both fails closed (Tap `1110`).
- **TAP-VOID-RETRY:** Void is not Tap-idempotent. The adapter does not retry void after `afterProviderSubmit`. Successful void is `outcome: "succeeded"` + `status: "cancelled"`.
- **TAP-REFUND-REASON:** Refund `reason` is `tapReason`, else caller `reason`, else `requested_by_customer`.
- **TAP-TYPES-CREATE:** `TapGateway.createPayment` accepts `tap*` fields (`TapCreatePaymentParams`) without excess-property errors.
- **TAP-1151-TIMEOUT:** Tap error code `1151` ("Gateway timed out") maps to `NetworkError`. Mutating 1151 is `afterProviderSubmit` (indeterminate after keyed retries), not a clean `GatewayApiError` failure.
- **TAP-PCI-DEAD:** PCI fence rejects `source.card` and PCI `on_file` independently.
- **TAP-TIMEOUT-MS:** `timeoutMs` is a positive millisecond timeout (default 30000). Non-positive values are rejected, not treated as "use default" or an instant abort.
- **TAP-HASH-CATCH:** `hashstring` verification fails closed on malformed payload or non-hex signature (`false`). Canonical amount remains ISO-padded.
- **TAP-HASH-VECTOR:** Tests verify Tap’s published Create-a-Charge `hashstring` header (docs example `sk_test_` + posted charge JSON). ISO amount padding is load-bearing for that vector.
